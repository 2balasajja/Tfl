# BDD with Selenium Webdriver and Specflow using C# 

Selenium WebDriver using CSharp as language binding

Due to lots of configuration issues with VS2019 , project is not running from feature files hence I utilised definations and converted as MS tests , then written tests, All tests are working 

BaseClass: Take care of starting and stopping of the webdriver
AppConfig : This will have all the configrations required for running the tests such as browser types etc#
Generic class: this will have the common methods for all the scripts
componenent helper: this will have component specific classes
